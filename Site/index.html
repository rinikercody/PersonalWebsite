					* These are some of the programming languages I use the most. I use C# and Javascript the most currently. When ever I need to create a desktop application in a windows environment I use C# because its easy and quick to create an application. For most case I default to javascript. I like how it works in whatever environment your in and with node.js it can be used to create some great desktop apps. I find that Python has several uses and a lot of support so it can solve a lot of problems and I end up using to solve some task. Every language has its advantages and I usually just use the one thats best for the task.
